### More about mechanics:
Two players compete in western duel using cards. Each card can have additional effect (and each card has "initiative" effect).
Each round each player has 3 cards, one of each type(described below).

Each player see his own card and enemy cards, this the key point where players build their strategy based on prediction what enemy could do.   

When cards is choosen, player also has to choose the part of the body where card will be used. Depends on the part of the body, card could have different effects.   

If player chooses card before enemy does it, the "initiative" effect activates. "Initiative" effect gives to player benefits, so it's always good to choose card early. Also, there is short time limit for card choosing. So, players have to choose cards as fast as possible, like shooting in western duel.


#### Cards
Two players compete in western duel using cards. Each card can have additional effect (and each card has "initiative" effect). In Wild Card there are three main types of cards:   
* **Attack Cards.** <span style="color: red">Red Color.</span>     
Attack cards deal damage to enemy and optionally could debuff him.
* **Heal Cards.** <span style="color: green">Green Color.</span>   
Heal cards increase health point and they could remove debuff from player.
* **Item cards.** <span style="color: blue">Blue Color.</span>  
Item cards are literally items that player can equip and gets some benefits(additional accuracy, ammo, damage).

#### Attack Cards
(Example is shown below)   
Attack card has the following properties:   
* **Amount of damage** for each hitted bullet(Left corner number "2" on example).
* **Amount of bullet** that this card uses(Right corner number "6" on example).   
Each bullet can deal damage that is shown in "Amount of damage" property. 
* **Accuracy modifier** (On example number "-5". For digital version of the game I use value in percent (0-100%). Number on example is used for dice in board version of the game).
* **Initiative effect** (On example is showned near arrow icon).   
Special effect that player activates when he choose card before enemy does it. On example player has additional accuracy.
* **Additional effect** (On example is showned with description of "bleeding" effect).   
Additional optional effect for this card.
* **Name of the card** (On example "6 shoots from revoler").   
Unique name of the card for identification and easy rembering.

#### Heal Cards
(Example is showned below)  
Heal card has the following properties:   
* **Amount of heal** by default (On example image number "+5"). Resulting heal depends on debuffs and the part of body which card is used to.
* **Initiative effect** (On example is showned near arrow icon).   
Special effect that player activates when he choose card before enemy does it. On example player doubles his heal.
* **Additional effect** (On example is showned with description of debuffing "bleeding" effect).   
Additional optional effect for this card.
* **Name of the card** (On example "bandage wounds").   
Unique name of the card for identification and easy rembering.

#### Item Cards
(Example is showned below)  
Item card has the following properties:   
* **Duration Time** (On example image number "5"). Shows how long the item card works in term of number of rounds. On example it means, that this item works 5 rounds including round that it was choosen. 
* **Card effect** (On example is showned with moving person icon).   
Special effect that this card gives to player. On example gives "+3" chance to dodge enemy attack. For digital version of the game I use value in percent (0-100%). Number on example is used for dice in board version of the game.
* **Initiative effect** (On example is showned near arrow icon).   
Special effect that player activates when he choose card before enemy does it. On example player increase his chance to dodge.
* **Additional effect** (On example there is no additional effect).   
Additional optional effect for this card, idea is the same as for attack and heal.
* **Name of the card** (On example "Make Flip").   
Unique name of the card for identification and easy rembering.
