### A bit more words: 
You as a … cupid … shape the fates of people by interacting with their surroundings and bringing together some of them who otherwise would not be able to find their true love.

### Game Spirit: 
The game resembles classic disney cartoons in terms of mood and content. In this way the game doesn’t take up very serious topics, or if it discusses them then it does it in a very playful form. In general the game can be described as sentimental, kind and humorous.
